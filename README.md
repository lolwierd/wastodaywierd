This is wastodaywierd — a minimal Next.js app that answers “was today weird?” by comparing Open‑Meteo forecast/reanalysis with 1991–2020 normals.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses Open‑Meteo APIs and Recharts for charts.
